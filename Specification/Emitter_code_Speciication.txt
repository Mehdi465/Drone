This code is used to transimt data using controller commands.
But first of all, I need to explicit all the commands I need. The idea is to reproduce commands im familiar with. I played GTA5 a lot so I will copy what they implemented : 
  RT -> Lift
  LT -> Descend
  RB -> Yaw right
  LB -> Yaw left
  left joystick front and back -> pitch
  left joystick left and right -> roll
  
  A -> sleep mode, wake up from sleep mode
  Y -> Atti mode
